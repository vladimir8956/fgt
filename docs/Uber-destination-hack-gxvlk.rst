Here are 12 hacks for Uber drivers to earn more. Waze is much more accurate and can get you to your destination quicker and safer. He hacks the system by setting East Bay Bart stations as his home destination -- a feature meant to get drivers home at the end of a long. You can call people to determine their destination and not pick up unprofitable rides but again, a short ride to deactivation. People have tried location.

UPDATE 9/28/ Since earlier in , Uber and Lyft are both experimenting with a feature where the destination address and/or estimated trip length are displayed *before* the trip is accepted. Lyft calls this the "Estimated Trip Time" and they have been testing this in certain markets with certain set of drivers.  · The distance is over 60 miles and uber tells me you can only set a df for 60 miles / km away. I would set a df for ~ 60 mile to the south and *if* I got a ride I would only have 1 df left, but still have 90 miles to go. So I started removing the df while on a trip and the majority of the time it doesn't reduce the destination filters  Interaction Count:   · There is a hack for this too.. Enter the destination that you would want to get down at first. When you reach your destination, ask your friends to get down and change your destination in the ENTER DESTINATION search bar above in the app. When you do that, the driver will accept the change and take you to the updated destination.
