My employment at Wing Shack came to teach me a lot more about kitchen work than I had previously understood. For example, no job I had prior to this was even remotely close to being as busy so I never really understood what the purpose for prepping so much in advance was. At Wing Shack, the reasoning behind it became clear very quickly/5(26). Employment may be conditional upon successful completion of a substance abuse screening test as part of the Company's pre-employment policy. If I become employed, I will be free to terminate my employment at any time for any reason, and that Wing Shack Enterprises Inc. retains the same rights. Our new location will feature a historic dining room, our signature hot wings, and four new exclusive Wing Shack drinks: Shack Beer, an American lager, which will be available at all Wing Shack locations, and three draft cocktails: The Shack-a-rita, the Twisted Bird, and Shack Punch. Come check out our new digs and keep spreading that #WingLove.
