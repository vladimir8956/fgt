   xbox system information 1. The hack requires a console that has not been updated to the August09 dashboard. Although some consoles with the kernel have already been patched to stop the JTAG hack. To find out what dashboard you have, turn on the System and navigate to the Settings. In there, hit "Console Settings". The Xbox motherboard has gone through several changes over the years. These changes often reduced die sizes of various chips (CPU (Xenon), GPU (Xenos), eDRAM, etc.), added new features (HDMI, etc.) and patched the SMC/JTAG  pages lists off all known motherboard revisions, their changes as well as links to their respective pages.  · xenon_ file (rename to hack and put in nandpro20 folder) hex comparison (or a md5 hash program) What you need to do 1. solder in the lpt/jtag wires (as in the picture attached to this tutorial) 2. boot your pc to the bios settings ans set the lpt to spp mode 3. boot to windows xp (vista is incompatible) install dlportio driver and reboot pc.
