  But there's a silver lining: it's basically a Raspberry Pi that can be manipulated, hacked, and transformed into a retro wonderbox. I have a hacked PS1 classic, and I would not recommend a 1TB drive. two USB controllers that can be used on your PC or raspberry pi. does RetroArch run any better on this than, say, a Raspberry Pi 3B+? it's slightly more expensive but i've heard that performance on the PS1.

I still have a hacked PSP I pull out very infrequently to play stuff, and a hacked Vita I almost never use so I'm actually getting oversaturated with ways to play Mario World for the 9th time though My thought too. So lack. Raspberry Pi 3+ vs Hacked PS Classic, which is best? Now that the PS Classic is finally having Retroarch, which is best to own for an emulation console, especially in regard to specs? I still don't own any of them, and I guess the 3b+ will need overclocking since I see several case bundles with a cooling fan to install over it.
