   · GPS-SIM. GPS-SIM is designed to use the HackRF to simulate GPS. This is a specific application the the GPS-SDR-SIM found at osqzss/gps-sdr-sim. Step 1 - Build Path to Simulate Export KML file from Google Maps. If trasnmitting a static location, skip to Step 3. Decide on a starting point and a destination to enter into Google Maps.  · We need a software-defined radio like HACKRF which could simulate GPS L1 signal.
