  Tasting is Believing. @ WINGSHACK. All Rights g: blacktown. We are excited to open our 9th Wing Shack location, located in historic downtown Johnstown Colorado at 21 North Parish Ave. In Wing Shack moved to its current premises at Sunnyholt Road, Kings Park, further expanding its menu to include burgers and wraps. It soon became known as institution for Fried Chicken in Sydney’s competitive food scene with many reviewers praising its chicken burgers as some of the best, if not the best in Australia.
