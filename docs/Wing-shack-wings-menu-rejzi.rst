Wing Shack Wrap. Grilled chicken, chopped bacon, lettuce, tomato, onions and shredded cheese wrapped in a tortilla. Served with our house ed Payment: All Major Cards. Wing Shack specialises in tasty chicken wings. Our flavour combinations take inspiration from across the world to create sauces which will not disappoint. We're not just about wings, our menu features fully loaded chicken burgers, wraps, fillets and boneless bites too, with the addition of our innovative 'bits on the side' to compliment and complete your meal. There has been a national shortage of wings. This decision has been made after long and careful consideration and as reluctant as we are to do so, it is necessary. We will no longer be offering Wing Tuesday specials. We pride ourselves in providing the community with the largest, fresh-only, wings. -The Shack Wings & Brews.
